# Digit-Recogziner-using-openCV-and-CNN
This code helps you classify digits using openCV and Convolutional Neural Network.

## Code Requirements 
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

## Python Implementation
1. Dataset- MNIST dataset
2. Images of size 28 X 28
3. Classify digits from 0 to 9
4. Convolutional Neural Network used.

## Train Accuracy ~ 98%

## How to use code
I have trained the model and saved it in
    HRD_using_cnn_opencv.h5. 
    The model gets loaded when you 
  run hrd_rec.py. 
  
  
## Execution using Webcam
